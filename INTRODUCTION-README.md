- 👋 Hi, I’m Sephora Bateman. I am a senior at the University of Utah studying Computer Science and I am set to graduate this spring with my bachelors. I can code on both the backend and frontend of a project. I like working on the frontend because I like formatting project to fit the user needs better but, I most of the time end up working on the backend. The languages I have the most experience in are Java, C#, C++, C with some experience in JavaScript, HTML and python.  
 
- 👀 I’m interested in Application and Web development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascrpit, C++,C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
