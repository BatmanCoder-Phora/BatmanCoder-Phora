- 👋 Hi, I’m Sephora Bateman. I am a senior at the University of Utah studying Computer Science and I am set to graduate this spring with my bachelors.  When it comes to the type of development on a project, I am fine to code on either both the backend and the frontend. I like different thing on each of the different development types for example, I like working on the frontend because making the project look nice for the clients however, I have worked on the backend of project more than the front end.  The languages I have the most experience in is Java, C#, C++, C with some experience in JavaScript, HTML, and python.   
 
- 👀 I’m interested in Application and Web development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascrpit, C++,C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
